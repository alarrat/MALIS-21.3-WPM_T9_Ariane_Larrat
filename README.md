### Task 1
***
A little intro about task 1

Task 1 was all about how to address processes in your own everyday work that are very data-focused (metadata or research data management). An example should be used to describe how to deal with this process and how to make it more sustainable, easier or more transparent. Now I don't work in a library at the moment, but we also have a problem with our files. We produce and aggregate vast amounts of imagery for our websites. The images are very large and bulky, making our websites slower and unattractive.
So in Task 1, I looked at how to prepare a digital image collection as web content (spoiler alert: unifying file names, reducing filesizes, and editing metadata all come up in this!).

## FAQs
***
A list of frequently asked questions
1.**Why would I do that to myself?**
Because I'm tired of wondering in environments that are littered with data treasures what actually happens to this data.
2. **Why do you do this to yourself?**
Because you can see in this repository that there are even more bloody beginners than you.
